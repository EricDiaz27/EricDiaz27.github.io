## The Orginal Projects

### [Project One](https://github.com/EricDiaz27/cs350) 
This project was chosen because it relates to software engineering and design. The class was CS350: Emerging Systems Architectures and Technologies. This aligns well with software engineering and design as you use a raspberry pi to make embedded systems and use python to make functionality.

### [Project Two](https://github.com/EricDiaz27/CS330)
The project for algorithms and data structures is from the class CS330 Computational Graphics and Visualization. There is a lot of data structure that goes into computer graphics to make the shapes and models you want.

### [Project Three](https://github.com/EricDiaz27/cs465)
The project that best aligned with databases was from the class CS465 Full Stack Development. The reason being it utilizes a database MongoDB to handle all the data on the website it is used on.
