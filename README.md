# I'm Eric Diaz

This is my portfolio of projects from SNHU!

I have learned many skills while pursuing a computer science degree. Iâ€™ve learned Java, C++, and Python. I also learned other important skills like NoSQL and web development. From the projects below the first one showcases my ability using Python and making functionality out of embedded systems. The second project utilizes OpenGL which is coded in C++. It showcases my use of data structures and algorithms creating a 3D scene. The third project is a website developed using the MEAN stack. It utilizes MongoDB showing my skills with NoSQL.

## The Orginal Projects

### [Project One](https://github.com/EricDiaz27/cs350) 
This project was chosen because it relates to software engineering and design. The class was CS350: Emerging Systems Architectures and Technologies. This aligns well with software engineering and design as you use a raspberry pi to make embedded systems and use python to make functionality.

### [Project Two](https://github.com/EricDiaz27/CS330)
The project for algorithms and data structures is from the class CS330 Computational Graphics and Visualization. There is a lot of data structure that goes into computer graphics to make the shapes and models you want.

### [Project Three](https://github.com/EricDiaz27/cs465)
The project that best aligned with databases was from the class CS465 Full Stack Development. The reason being it utilizes a database MongoDB to handle all the data on the website it is used on.
