# I'm Eric Diaz

This is my portfolio of projects from SNHU!

I have learned many skills while pursuing a computer science degree. I’ve learned Java, C++, and Python. I also learned other important skills like NoSQL and web development. From the projects below the first one showcases my ability using Python and making functionality out of embedded systems. The second project utilizes OpenGL which is coded in C++. It showcases my use of data structures and algorithms creating a 3D scene. The third project is a website developed using the MEAN stack. It utilizes MongoDB showing my skills with NoSQL.

## The Orginal Projects

### [Project One](https://github.com/EricDiaz27/cs350) 
This project was chosen because it relates to software engineering and design. The class was CS350: Emerging Systems Architectures and Technologies. This aligns well with software engineering and design as you use a raspberry pi to make embedded systems and use python to make functionality. For the embedded system I had to make a thermostat that read the temperature and gave you the current time. I also had to make the UI readable and simple. 

### [Project Two](https://github.com/EricDiaz27/CS330)
The project for algorithms and data structures is from the class CS330 Computational Graphics and Visualization. There is a lot of data structure that goes into computer graphics to make the shapes and models you want. For the scene I had to make lots of meshes, lighting, and texturing. I also had to make a camera system so that you can move around the scene.

### [Project Three](https://github.com/EricDiaz27/cs465)
The project that best aligned with databases was from the class CS465 Full Stack Development. The reason being it utilizes a database MongoDB to handle all the data on the website it is used on. The data it handled was the information about where to stay, I also had to make a CRUD system to connect to MongoDB. CRUD is the most important part being able to upload, edit, and delete is crucial for the places where you are going to stay. 


## Project Enchanments

### [Project One](https://github.com/EricDiaz27/cs499P1)
For the project one enhancement I wanted to add more to the UI. What I did was add an Up arrow when the user wanted to raise the temperature. A down arrow for when the user wanted it colder. I also added a pause symbol when the temperature goal was met. To make this functionality I add if and else statements to ensure if certain criteria are met the symbols will show.

### [Project Two](https://github.com/EricDiaz27/cs499P2)
For the project two enhancements I made a new 3D scene. The scene is a trail in a forest, making this scene was great.  The process of modifying the artifact was not too hard since I left great comments so I can remember where everything is and what it does. I learned how to fix texture UVs in OpenGL, specifically on the dirt texture because it was super stretched at first. I tried to make the trees have branches but I realized how hard that is going to be, so I opted to have the trees be huge and tall so you actually can't see the branches if you are on the trail. The main component that shows off my skill is making meshes trying to look like a real life object.  I also used Blender to make custom bark and dirt textures for this project, which utilizes understanding data structures to make anything in Blender.

### [Project Three](https://github.com/EricDiaz27/cs499P3)
For this project three enhancement I switched it to something I would like, so I made it into an e-commerce store like ebay, but it is art related where you can only sell pieces of art. I used the MEAN stack for it  and working with MongoDB is great. It is easy to understand the tables and it’s easy to connect the database to the application. I made a create function and edit function for the database to collect the data. Making a new site was challenging because using angular is still a little difficult for me.
